This paper originates from a classical interpolation problem: how to reconstruct a cubic polynomial
from its finite differences.
The investigation leads to an unexpected identity expressing $n^3$ as a sum involving products of linear terms,
revealing a hidden combinatorial structure.
This identity serves as a base case of a more general pattern.
By solving systems of linear equations, a family of identities is derived that express
arbitrary odd powers $n^{2m+1}$ as symmetric bivariate sums.
A recurrence relation for these expressions is obtained via an associated generating function,
enabling recursive construction of the coefficients.
The main results include several equivalent formulations of the odd power identity,
a binomial version, and an identity for the sum of odd powers.
The findings are supported by symbolic computations in \textit{Mathematica}.
Related directions include spline-based approximations to power functions,
symmetric two-sided versions of Faulhaber's formula, and a formal link between
the ordinary derivatives of odd powers and the structure of the derived identities.
