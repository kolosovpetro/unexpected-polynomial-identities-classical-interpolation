The author is grateful to Albert Tkaczyk for pointing out the idea of the general form of odd power identity,
and for providing examples of how to build and solve systems of linear equations to evaluate
the coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$.
The author is grateful to Max Alekseyev (George Washington University) for providing a valuable contribution
of recurrence relation~\eqref{prop:coefficients_a}.
The author is grateful to Markus Scheuer for his elegant and beautiful proof
of the lemma~\eqref{lem:altering-binomial-identity}, see~\cite{scheuer2023mathstackexchange}.
Finally, the author is grateful to OEIS editors for their valuable work during the contribution of sequences
related to this manuscript.
