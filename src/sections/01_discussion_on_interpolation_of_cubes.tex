This is the story of a student with a deep curiosity for mathematics.
Although, not a specialist in mathematics,
our young explorer always possessed a strong sense of mathematical beauty and aesthetics.
The mathematical knowledge of the individual was limited by undergraduate level course, which includes the basics of
matrix operations, basic calculus, and elementary linear algebra.
One day, our student found himself observing the tables of finite differences, precisely finite differences of cubes.

By observing the table
\input{sections/figures/01_fig_finite_differences_cubes}
The first question that visited curious mind was
\begin{question}
    \label{quest:interpolation-cubes}
    How to reconstruct the value of $n^3$ from the values of its finite differences?
\end{question}
Precisely, the inquiry is to find a way to reconstruct the values of the sequence $\{0, 1, 8, 27, 64, \ldots\}$
given the values of finite differences in the table~\eqref{tab:finite-differences-cubes}.

In its essence, the problem is so old that it can be traced back
to ancient Babylonian and Greek times, several centuries BC and first centuries AD~\cite{gautschi2012interpolation}.
The process of finding new data points based on the range of a discrete set
of known data points is called interpolation.
Interpolation, as we know it today, was developed in 1674--1684 by Isaac Newton
in his works referenced as foundation of classical interpolation theory~\cite{meijering2002chronology}.
For instance, Newton's interpolation formula addresses the question~\eqref{quest:interpolation-cubes} immediately,
because
\begin{align*}
    27 = 6 \binom{3}{3} + 6 \binom{3}{2} + 1 \binom{3}{1} + 0\binom{3}{0} = 6 + 18 + 3
\end{align*}
where $6,6,1,0$ is the first row in table~\eqref{tab:finite-differences-cubes}.
In general,
\begin{align*}
    n^3 = 6 \binom{n}{3} + 6 \binom{n}{2} + 1\binom{n}{1} + 0 \binom{n}{0}
\end{align*}
because $f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{d} \Delta^{d-k} f(0) \binom{x}{d-k}$, see~\cite[~p. 190]{graham1994concrete}.

Great!
But there is one thing, the student who has risen the question~\eqref{quest:interpolation-cubes}
had no clue about interpolation theory at all.
What was decided then?
Exactly, our inquirer has decided to find a solution himself, being driven by the pure feeling of mystery.
His mind was occupied by only a single thought:
\textit{All mathematical truths exist timelessly, we only reveal and describe them.}
That mindset inspired our student to start his own mathematical journey.

By observing the table of finite differences~\eqref{tab:finite-differences-cubes} we can notice that
the first finite difference of cubes may be expressed in terms of its
third finite differences $\Delta^3(n^3) = 6$, as follows
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta(0^3) &= 1+6 \cdot 0 \\
        \Delta(1^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1 \\
        \Delta(2^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2 \\
        \Delta(3^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3 \\
        &\; \; \vdots \\
        \Delta(n^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3 + \cdots + 6n
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
By using sigma notation, we get
\begin{align*}
    \Delta(n^3) = 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3+\cdots+6\cdot n = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k
\end{align*}

However, there is a more beautiful way to prove that $\Delta(n^3) = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k$.
We refer to one of the finest articles in the area of polynomials and power sums,
that is \textit{Johann Faulhaber and sums of powers} written by Donald Knuth~\cite{knuth1993johann}.
Indeed, this article is a great mean to reach piece of mind in mathematics.
We now focus on the odd power identities shown at~\cite[~p. 9]{knuth1993johann}
\begin{align*}
    n^1 &= \binom{n}{1} \\
    n^3 &= 6 \binom{n+1}{3} + \binom{n}{1} \\
    n^5 &= 120 \binom{n+2}{5} + 30 \binom{n+1}{3} + \binom{n}{1}
\end{align*}

It is quite interesting that the identity in terms of triangular numbers $\binom{n+1}{2}$
and finite differences of cubes becomes more obvious
\begin{align*}
    \Delta n^3
    = (n+1)^3 - n^3
    =  6 \binom{n+1}{2} + \binom{n}{0}
\end{align*}
It easy to see that
\begin{align*}
    \Delta n^3
    = \left[ 6 \binom{n+2}{3} + \binom{n+1}{1} \right] - \left[ 6 \binom{n+1}{3} + \binom{n}{1} \right]
    = 6 \binom{n+1}{2} + \binom{n}{0}
\end{align*}
because $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

Moreover, the concept above allows us to reach $N$-fold power sums $\sum^N k^{2m+1}$
or finite differences $\Delta^N k^{2m+1}$ by simply altering
binomial coefficients indexes.
Quite strong and impressive.

We can observe that triangular numbers $\binom{n+1}{2}$ are equivalent to
\begin{align*}
    \binom{n+1}{2} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{k}{1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} k
\end{align*}
because $\binom{n+1}{m+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{k}{m}$.
This leads us to the fact that
\begin{align*}
    \Delta n^3 = (n+1)^3 - n^3 = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k
\end{align*}
An experienced mathematician would immediately notice a spot to apply Faulhaber's formula~\cite{beardon1996sums}
to get the closed form of the sum $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k$
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2)
\end{align*}
Thus, the finite difference $\Delta(n^3)$ takes the well-known form,
which matches Binomial theorem~\cite{abramowitz1988handbook}
\begin{align*}
    \Delta(n^3)
    = 1 + 6 \left[ \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2) \right]
    = 1 + 3 n + 3 n^2
    = \sum_{k=0}^{2} \binom{3}{k} n^k
\end{align*}
And\ldots that could be the end of the story, isn't it?
Because all what remains is to say that
\begin{align*}
    n^3
    = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1)^3 - k^3
    = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left( 1 + 6 \sum_{t=0}^{k} t \right)
    = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1 + 3 k + 3 k^2
\end{align*}
Thus, the formula for polynomial $n^3$ is derived successfully, and thus,
our protégée's question~\eqref{quest:interpolation-cubes} is answered positively.
Because we have successfully found the function that matches $n^3$ from the values of its finite differences from the
table~\eqref{tab:finite-differences-cubes}.

However, not this time.
Luckily enough (say), the student who has stated the question~\eqref{quest:interpolation-cubes}
wasn't really aware of the approaches above neither.
What a lazy student!
Probably, that's exactly the case when unawareness leads to a fresh sight to classical questions,
leading to unexpected results and new insights.
Instead, our investigator spotted a little bit different pattern in $\Delta n^3= 6 \binom{n+1}{2} + \binom{n}{0}$.

Consider the polynomial $n^3$ as sum of its finite differences
\begin{align*}
    n^3
    &= [1+6\cdot0] \\
    &+ [1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1] \\
    &+ [1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2] + \cdots \\
    &+ [1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+\cdots+6\cdot(n-1)]
\end{align*}
We can observe that the term $1$ appears $n$ times, the item $6\cdot0$ appears $n-0$ times,
the item $6\cdot1$ appears $n-1$ times and so on.
By rearranging recurring common terms
\begin{align*}
    n^3 = n
    &+ [(n-0) \cdot 6 \cdot 0] \\
    &+ [(n-1)\cdot6\cdot1] \\
    &+ [(n-2)\cdot6\cdot2] + \cdots \\
    &+ [(n-k)\cdot 6 \cdot k] + \cdots \\
    &+ [1\cdot6\cdot(n-1)]
\end{align*}
By applying compact sigma sum notation yields an identity for cubes $n^3$
\begin{align*}
    n^3 = n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 6k(n-k)
\end{align*}
We can freely move the term $n$ under the summation, because there are exactly $n$ iterations.
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
    n^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 6k(n-k) + 1
\end{align*}
By inspecting the expression $6k(n-k) + 1$, we can notice that it is symmetric over $k$.
Let be $T_{1} (n,k) = 6k(n-k) + 1$ then
\begin{align*}
    T_{1} (n,k) = T_{1} (n,n-k)
\end{align*}
This symmetry allows us to alter summation bounds easily.
Hence,
\begin{align*}
    n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k) + 1
\end{align*}
By arranging the values of $T_{1} (n,k)$ as a triangular array, we see that cube identities indeed are true
\input{sections/figures/02_fig_triangle_row_sums_give_cubes}
The following recurrence holds for $T_{1} (n,k)$
\begin{align*}
    T_{1} (n, k) = 2T_{1} (n-1, k) - T_{1} (n-2, k)
\end{align*}
Which is indeed true, because
\begin{align*}
    T_{1} (5, 2) = 2 \cdot 25 - 13 = 37
\end{align*}
Finally, our curious learner has reached the first milestone, by finding his own
answer to the question~\eqref{quest:interpolation-cubes} and the answer was positive.
What an excitement it was!
However, it wouldn't take long.
Indeed, curiosity is not something that can be fulfilled completely,
and thus new questions arise.
Somehow, the inquirer got a strong feeling that something bigger, something even more general
hides behind the identity $n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k) + 1$.
That was quite intuitive.
Fair enough that the next question was
\begin{question}
    Given that the identity $n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k) + 1$ holds for the polynomial $n^3$,
    can it be extended or generalized to higher-degree powers, such as $n^4$ or $n^5$,
    in a similar manner?
    \label{question:higher_powers}
\end{question}

However, this time it was not so easy for the young explorer to find identity for $n^4$ or $n^5$
by simply observing the tables of finite differences.
The previous approach to express the difference of cubes $\Delta n^3$ in terms of
$\Delta^3 n^3 = 6$ and then express the cubes as $n^3 = \sum_k 6k (n-k) +1$ --- was not successful.
Moreover, it wasn't even clear what is the generic form of an identity our student was looking for,
a lot of concerns came from a simple interpolation task.
Thus, the question~\eqref{question:higher_powers} was shared with the mathematical community.
And there was an answer.
