Back then, in 2016 being a student at the faculty of mechanical engineering,
I remember myself playing with finite differences of the polynomial $n^3$ over the domain of natural numbers $n\in\mathbb{N}$
having at most $0 \leq n \leq 20$ values.
Looking to the values in my finite difference tables, the first and very naive question that came to my mind was
\begin{question}
    Is it possible to re-assemble the value of the polynomial $n^3$ backwards
    having its finite differences?
\end{question}
The answer to this question is certainly \textit{Yes}, by utilizing interpolation methods.
Interpolation is a process of finding new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points.
It has been well-developed in between 1674--1684
by Issac Newton's fundamental works, nowadays known as foundation of classical interpolation
theory~\cite{meijering2002chronology}.

At that time, in 2016, I was a first-year mechanical engineering undergraduate.
Therefore, due to lack of knowledge in mathematics, I started re-inventing interpolation
formula myself, fueled by purest passion and feeling of mystery.
\textit{All mathematical laws and relations exist from the very beginning, but we only reveal and describe them}, I thought.
That mindset truly inspired me so that my own mathematical journey began.

Let's start considering the table of finite differences of the polynomial $n^3$
\input{sections/figures/01_fig_finite_differences_cubes}
First and foremost, we can observe that finite difference $\Delta(n^3)$ of the polynomial $n^3$
can be expressed through summation over $n$, e.g
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cubes_interpolation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta(0^3) &= 1+6 \cdot 0 \\
        \Delta(1^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1 \\
        \Delta(2^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2 \\
        \Delta(3^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3 \\
        &\; \; \vdots
    \end{split}
\end{align}
Finally reaching its generic form
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(n^3) = 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3+\cdots+6\cdot n = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k\label{eq:general-cube-eq}
\end{equation}
The one experienced mathematician would immediately notice a spot to apply Faulhaber's formula~\cite{beardon1996sums}
to expand the term $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k$ reaching expected result that matches Binomial theorem~\cite{abramowitz1988handbook},
so that
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2)
\end{equation*}
Then our relation~\eqref{eq:general-cube-eq} immediately turns into Binomial expansion
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(n^3) = (n+1)^3 - n^3 = 1 + 6 \left[ \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2) \right] = 1 + 3 n + 3 n^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{2} \binom{3}{k} n^k
    \label{eq:cubes-difference-binomial-theorem}
\end{equation}
However, as was said, I was not the experienced one mathematician back then,
so that I reviewed the relation~\eqref{eq:general-cube-eq} from a little bit different perspective.
Not following the convenient solution~\eqref{eq:cubes-difference-binomial-theorem},
I have introduced the explicit formula for cubes, using~\eqref{eq:cubes_interpolation}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rearrangement_to_get_cubes}
    n^3 &= [1+6\cdot0]+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1]+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2]+\cdots \nonumber \\
    &+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+\cdots+6\cdot(n-1)]
\end{align}
Then, rearranging the terms in equation~\eqref{eq:rearrangement_to_get_cubes} so that it turns into summation
in terms of $k (n-k)$
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        n^3 &= n + [(n-0) \cdot 6 \cdot 0] + [(n-1)\cdot6\cdot1] + [(n-2)\cdot6\cdot2] + \cdots \\
        &\cdots + [(n-k)\cdot 6 \cdot k] + \cdots + [1\cdot6\cdot(n-1)]
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
By applying compact sigma notation and moving $n$ under summation because there is exactly $n$ iteration, yields
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cube_identity}
    n^3 = n + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k); \quad \quad n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k) + 1
\end{equation}
\input{sections/figures/02_fig_triangle_row_sums_give_cubes}
Therefore, we have reached our base case by successfully interpolating the polynomial $n^3$.
Fairly enough that the next curiosity would be
\begin{question}
    Well, if the relation~\eqref{eq:cube_identity} true for the polynomial $n^3$,
    then is it true that~\eqref{eq:cube_identity} can be generalized for higher powers, e.g.\ for $n^4$ or $n^5$ similarly?
    \label{question:higher_powers}
\end{question}
That was the next question, however without any expectation of the final form of generalized formula.
Long story short, the answer to this question is also \textit{Yes}, by utilizing certain approaches
in terms of systems of linear equations or recurrence formula, which is discussed.
