Wew support out research with additional Wolfram Mathematica programs to validate
the main results.
Refer to the
\href{https://github.com/kolosovpetro/surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation}
{\texttt{GitHub repository}} to find the Mathematica files
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation.m} --- is the package file
    where all functions are defined, execute it (Shift+Enter) before testing.
    \item \texttt{surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation.nb} --- is a working notebook
    where functions are used to validate the main results.
\end{itemize}
To test equation use the following commands
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerIdentity[n, m]}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerIdentitySimplified[n, m]}
    \item \texttt{BivariateSumT[m, n, k]}
    \item \texttt{RecurrenceForT[m, n, k]}
    \item \texttt{TableFormBivariateSumT[m, rows]}
    \item \texttt{TableFormRecurrenceForT[m, rows]}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerDecomposition[n, m]}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerDecompositionMMinus1[n, m]}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerBinomialForm[m, n, a]}
    \item \texttt{OddPowerBinomialFormShifted[m, n, a]}
\end{itemize}
