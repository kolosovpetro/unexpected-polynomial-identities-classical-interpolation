Wew support out research with additional Wolfram Mathematica programs to validate
the main results.
Refer to the
\href{https://github.com/kolosovpetro/surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation}
{\texttt{GitHub repository}} to find the Mathematica files
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation.m} --- is the package file
    where all functions are defined, execute it (Shift+Enter) before testing.
    \item \texttt{surprising-polynomial-identities-classical-interpolation.nb} --- is a working notebook
    where functions are used to validate the main results.
\end{itemize}
To test equation use the following commands
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\texttt{OddPowerIdentity[n, 2]} = (n+1) \left(n^3-n^2+n-1\right) n+n$ --- validates odd power
    identity~\eqref{theorem:odd-power-identity} for $m=0,1,2,\ldots$, in this example $m=2$.
    \item $\texttt{OddPowerIdentitySimplified[n, 4]} = n^9$ --- validates odd power
    identity~\eqref{theorem:odd-power-identity} for $m=0,1,2,\ldots$ and simplifies it, in this example $m=4$.
    \item $\texttt{BivariateSumT[10, 3, 2]}$
    \item $\texttt{RecurrenceForT[10, 3 , 2]}$
    \item \texttt{TableForm[Table[BivariateSumT[3, n, k], \{n, 0, 10\}, \{k, 0, n\}],
        TableAlignments -> Left]}
    \item \texttt{TableForm[Table[RecurrenceForT[3, n, k], \{n, 0, 10\}, \{k, 0, n\}],
        TableAlignments -> Left]}
    \item $\texttt{OddPowerDecomposition[n, 5]} = n^{11}$
    \item $\texttt{OddPowerBinomialForm[2, 15, 5]} = 3125 = 5^5$
\end{itemize}
