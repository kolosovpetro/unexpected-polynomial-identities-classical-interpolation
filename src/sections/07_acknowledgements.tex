The author is grateful to Albert Tkaczyk for pointing out the idea of the general form of odd power identity,
and for providing examples of how to build and solve systems of linear equations to evaluate $\coeffA{m}{r}$.
The author is grateful to Max Alekseyev (George Washington University) for providing a valuable contribution
of recurrence relation for coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$.
The author is grateful to Markus Scheuer for his help in proving the identity~\eqref{eq:combinatorial-identity},
the proof is elegant and beautiful.
Finally, the author is grateful to OEIS editors for their valuable work during the sequences
related to this manuscript were submitted.
