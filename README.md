# Unexpected polynomial identities arising from a classical interpolation problem

This paper originates from a classical interpolation problem: how to reconstruct a cubic polynomial
from its finite differences.
The investigation leads to an unexpected identity expressing $n^3$ as a sum involving products of linear terms,
revealing a hidden structure.
This identity serves as a base case of a more general pattern.
By solving systems of linear equations, a family of odd power identities $n^{2m+1}$
involving special numbers $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ and symmetric bivariate sums.
A recurrence relation for these coefficients $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$
is obtained via a specific generating function, enabling recursive construction of the coefficients.
The main results include several odd power identities, an identity for binomial version,
and identities for sums of odd powers.
